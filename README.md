# My Hands
Some hand reading research and jotted down random code for my experiments with analysing various hands!


## Important tips

 - select hand left or right
 - examine both hands to make final decision/conclusion
 - active hand stores the present, passive hand stores the information the person was born with.


#### Hypothesis/Assumptions to be evaluated
 - passive hand (usually left) hand sustains childhood characters, that means they dont change much.
   i.e my hands should resemble my father and my son's left hand.
 - most humans by age of 6, gets 80% of their mental/psycholoical development.
 - left hand shows more biologic characters we are born with,
 - active hand shows how we have evolved from our biologic characters to other characters by exposure to different situations, events, people etc.
